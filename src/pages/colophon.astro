                <p>
                    This site is built with <a href="https://astro.build/"
                        >Astro</a
                    >, a modern static site generator that prioritizes
                    performance and developer experience. Astro's partial
                    hydration and islands architecture allow for fast loading
                    times while maintaining interactive components where needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Styling is handled by <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
                        >Tailwind CSS</a
                    >
                    v4, providing utility-first CSS classes for rapid development
                    and consistent design patterns.

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>
                    The site uses <a
                        href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont"
                        >Atkinson Hyperlegible</a
                    >, a font designed by the Braille Institute to improve
                    readability for everyone, including people with low vision.
                    The font is loaded as a variable font through Astro's font
                    optimization system.

                <p>
                    Code is written primarily in <a href="https://zed.dev/"
                        >Zed</a
                    > and
                    <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, version controlled
                    with Git, and hosted on a self-hosted <a
                        href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a
                    >
                    instance running on my homelab infrastructure.

                <h3>Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    The site is statically generated and deployed automatically
                    via a CI pipeline in my homelab infrastructure. Changes
                    pushed to the main branch trigger builds that generate
                    optimized static files which is then simply scp'd to the
                    server.

                <h3>Performance Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    The site is designed with performance in mind: minimal
                    JavaScript, optimized images, and efficient CSS delivery.
                    Astro's zero-JS-by-default approach ensures fast page loads
                    and excellent Core Web Vitals scores.

            <article>
                <h3>Accessibility First</h3>
                <p>
                    The site prioritizes accessibility with semantic HTML,
                    proper heading hierarchy, sufficient color contrast, and the
                    highly legible Atkinson Hyperlegible typeface. Dark mode
                    support respects user preferences via the <code
                        >prefers-color-scheme</code
                    > media query.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Minimal & Functional</h3>
                <p>
                    The design embraces simplicity and readability over flashy
                    effects. Content is king, and the interface stays out of the
                    way to let the writing shine through.
