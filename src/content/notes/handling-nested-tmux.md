I usually like to use tmux locally, and on [[word]] (my VPS) I run a tmux session to have both my website and the Minecraft server perpetually running.

The problem arises when trying to use tmux keybinds, where I am in a tmux session locally, SSH into [[word]], and open that tmux session. The key combinations do not work, however, I learned if I pressed the prefix combination `<C-b>` twice, or `<C-b-b>`, it executes the keybind in the nested session!
